    question: "How do I find properties to rent?",
    answer: "Simply browse through property listings by swiping. Swipe right to like a property you're interested in, or swipe left to pass. When you match with a property owner, you can start chatting to arrange viewings and discuss details."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I like a property?",
    answer: "When you like a property by swiping right, the property owner is notified. If they're interested in you as a potential tenant, they can like your profile back, creating a match. Once matched, you can message each other directly."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I message property owners?",
    answer: "You can message property owners once you have a match. Go to your matches or messages section to start a conversation. Note that messaging may require message credits depending on your subscription plan."
  },
  {
    question: "What are message credits?",
    answer: "Message credits are required to initiate conversations with property owners. You receive a certain number of credits based on your subscription plan. Premium plans offer more credits and better visibility."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I upgrade my subscription?",
    answer: "Go to Settings > Premium Packages to view available subscription plans. Premium plans give you more message credits, better visibility in search results, and additional features like super likes."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Super Like?",
    answer: "A Super Like is a way to show extra interest in a property. Property owners see Super Likes highlighted, making you stand out from other potential tenants. Super Likes are available with premium subscriptions."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I view properties I've liked?",
    answer: "Go to your Liked Properties section from the main menu. There you can see all properties you've shown interest in and track your matches."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I filter property searches?",
    answer: "Yes! Use the filters to narrow down properties by location, price range, property type (apartment, house, room), number of bedrooms, pet policy, and other amenities you need."
  },
  {
    question: "How do contracts work?",
    answer: "Once you and a property owner agree on terms, you can create and sign contracts through the app. Go to Settings > Contracts to view and manage your rental agreements."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I report a problem or inappropriate content?",
    answer: "If you encounter any issues, you can report users or listings directly from their profile or listing page. You can also contact support through Settings > FAQ & Help for assistance."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I delete my account?",
    answer: "Go to Settings > Security, scroll to the bottom to find the Danger Zone section where you can delete your account. Note that this action is permanent and cannot be undone."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my information secure?",
    answer: "Yes, we take your privacy seriously. We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your data. Read our Privacy Policy for more details on how we handle your information."
